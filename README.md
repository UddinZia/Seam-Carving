# Seam-Carving
uses the seam-carving algorithim developed by Shai Avidan to rescale an image with out losing too much information. 
seam carving algorithim works by calcualting the energy of each pixel using an equation and then making a list of seams. These seams are then ranked from lowest to highest energy with the lowest energy seem being of least importance
